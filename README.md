# Creating a Mobile Wireframe
In this video, we'll create a wireframe for a mobile scree size.

We'll start by creating the header navigation area with a dropdown menu icon.

Next, we'll create the post content, then the sidebar content area, finally we'll wrap up with the footer content.

We'll be using shared text styles to create several text styles for headings other types of texts that we'll use in the wireframes.
