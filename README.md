# Project Brief

An overview of the what a project brief is, how it allows us to create much better defined project that will better achieve the goals at hand. We'll also be covering our project at hand (Freelance Jump) and treat it like a client project.

## What is a Project Brief?
A document that summarizes your project, the process required to make it happen, and the goals it hopes to achieve.
This includes things like the scope of the project, timeline, and the budget required to do it.
