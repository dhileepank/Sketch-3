###[Daily UI](http://www.dailyui.co)
Daily UI is a 100 day Newsletter that provides you design challenges (e.g. header, shopping cart, etc.). It's a great way to improve your design skills and keep them sharp.

###[Dribbble](https://dribbble.com)
Dribbble is a "show and tell" for designers where you can upload your design in a 800x600px image.

###[Behance](https://www.behance.net)
Behance lets creatives create their own portfolios. It's similar to Dribbble, but more inclusive in the sense that it's meant for all types of creatives (not just designers) and allows you to add context to your work by writing about it instead jsut uploading a 800x600px image

###[Site Inspire](https://www.siteinspire.com)
Site Inpire is a great source of inspiration for wbesite that agencies have done. It features work a lot less "out-there" than sites like Awwwards.

###[SitePoint Tutorials](https://www.sitepoint.com/premium)
