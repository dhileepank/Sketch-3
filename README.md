# Working with Color Palettes

While colors and branding are usually chosen by clients, we'll be doing this ourselves as it's our project.

Before you start with any color, you should get better with using grayscale design to create areas of focus, and then slowly start to add color to it. Don't use color as a crutch.

## Use a Base Color
Pick a single color to be the base of the color in your design. This color should be used most throughout your design.

In our project, we'll be using a shade of blue (Hex #4A90E2) as out base color.

## Use an accent color
Pick a color that goes well with your base color, it can be a complimentary color to your base color, or a heavy tint of it, it all depends on your design.
