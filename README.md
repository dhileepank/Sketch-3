# Sketch Workspace Setup
In this video, weâ€™ll set up the workspace in sketch. This will include preferences and installing some plugins.

## Sketch Preferences
We'll start off my going to Sketch > Preferences, and turn on pixel-fittings, and turn on strip text style when pasting.

## Plugins
We'll use the following plugins to allow for a easier workflow:

- [Craft by InVision](https://www.invisionapp.com/craft) - This amazing plugin lets you create dummy content, duplicate layers in an intellgient way, and now even create prototypes!
- [Sketch-Measure](https://github.com/utom/sketch-measure) - This plugin allows you to create annotations on your design to let develoeprs know the exact measurements of different elements in your documents (i.e. the height of your header, the distance between to content areas, etc.)
- [Hipsterfill](https://github.com/sdrib/HipsterFill) - This is a dummy text generator that uses hipster buzzwords.
- [Sketch Toolbox](http://sketchtoolbox.com) - This is app lets you download plugins from github and isntall them automatically to Sketch.
- [Nudge It](http://nudg.it) - This standalone plugins lets you adjust your nudge and big nudge settings.
