# Designing the UI for Tablet

In this video, we will use our design for mobile view to create a design for a tablet view.

### Header
We'll start by creating a new header that has navigation links

### Layout
We'll create a new layout where the content areas will move to the right of the blog area, and the footer content will be at the bottom.
