# Creating a Desktop Wireframe

We will now wireframe the home page for the desktop screen size. The main from the tablet size wireframe is the the blog section is now epxanded to two columns after the fetured blog post. This gives the featured article more attention, as well as uses the expanded screen size of a desktop more effectively. Other differences are that the footer links are now all in one row.
