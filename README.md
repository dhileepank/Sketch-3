# Designing the Header for Mobile
In this video, we'll be designing the header for  mobile screen, which will include a logo and a hamburger icon.

We'll then create a banner using the rectangle tool and make it a our base color of blue. We'll add the hex of#4A90E2 to our document colors so we can easily access it later. Furthermore, we'll create a shared style called banner so that we can easily create banners for other screen sizes.
