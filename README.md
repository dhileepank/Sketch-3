# Style Tiles
A Style Tile is ike a Style Guide without all the fuss.

It helps you figure out the look and feel of your design, the "visual ingredients" of your design.
A style tile is an inbetween solution between a moodboard and a full-blown style guide.

Moodboard → Style Guide → Mockup

**Consists of:**
- Fonts
- Colors
- Patterns / Textures
- Adjectives
- Buttons/ Design Elements
