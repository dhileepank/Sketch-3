# Annotating Your Designs for Developers

## Congrats! You've made it all the way through the course!

This last section will show you how to:
- Annotate your designs for developers for a seamless design process
- Package and deliver Sketch files and assets to send to developers and/or clients
- Next steps you should take to become a better designer
- 

## Annotate Your Designs
We'll be using the Sketch-Measure plugin to create annotations for sizes and distances in the design elements so our developer can use the exact measurements you created.
